                    <h3>“La Purisima Concepcion Church”</h3>
                    <ol>"Baclayon Church"</ol>
                    <ol>Year Built: 1596</ol>
                    <ol>Located: Baclayon Art Museum</ol>
                    <ol>Architectural Styles: Baroque Architecture, Neoclassical Architecture</ol>
                    <p>The oldest Christian colony in Bohol was established in 1596 by Gabriel Sanchez and Juan de Torres, two Jesuit priests. Construction on the church started in 1717 and was finished in 1737. Bohol's Baclayon Church has been designated
                        as a National Historic Landmark and National Cultural Treasure. It dates back to 1727 and is one of the oldest Catholic churches in the Philippines. The building's original structure and original materials are still present. It
                        is regarded as the oldest church in Bohol and was constructed in 1596. Its imposing exterior opens to an interior that is unquestionably gorgeous and contains a gold-plated altar as well as a variety of ancient religious objects
                        and images. The ceilings of the church also had murals, most of which had been replaced by monochromatic tin sheets. Even though the majority of the ceiling paintings were not preserved, parts of the crossing still display a 1957
                        original by Max Aya-ay. Father Ubeda ordered wooden Stations of the Cross paintings for the walls in 1859, but those paintings were later replaced by ones made in Europe.
