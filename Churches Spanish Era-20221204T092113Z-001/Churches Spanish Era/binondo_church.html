                    <h3>“Binondo Church, Manila”</h3>

                    <ol>Year Built: 1710</ol>
                    <ol>Located: Marcos Ave. Paoay, Ilocos Norte</ol>

                    <p>The Binondo District of Manila, Philippines, is home to Binondo Church, also known as the Minor Basilica and National Shrine of Saint Lorenzo Ruiz and formerly known as Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish. It is situated in front
                        of Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz. To assist their Chinese Christians who had converted to Christianity, Dominican priests established this church in 1596. On the same location, a new granite church was finished in 1852, but it was severely
                        damaged during World War II, with just the western façade and the octagonal bell tower surviving. Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, who was raised in this church and was of Chinese and Filipino descent, later traveled to Japan as a missionary
                        where he and his comrades were killed for standing up for Christianity. The first saint in the Philippines, Lorenzo, was declared a saint in 1987 by Pope John Paul II. The Catholic Missionaries were forced to oversee the conversion
                        of the Chinese population to Christianity due to the increase in their population. Dominican priests established Binondo Church in 1596 to minister to both the native Filipinos and their Chinese converts who had converted to Christianity.
