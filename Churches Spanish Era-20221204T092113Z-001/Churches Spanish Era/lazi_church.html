                    <h3>“San Isidro Labrador Parish Church”</h3>
                    <ol>"Lazi Church"</ol>
                    <ol>Year Built: 1884</ol>
                    <ol>Located: Lazi, Siquijor</ol>
                    <ol>Architectural Styles: Neoclassical Architecture</ol>
                    <p>Lazi (formerly Tigbawan) broke away from Siquijor on August 8, 1857, to become its own parish. The bell tower and the existing stone church were built by Filipino artisans in 1884 and 1885, respectively. The monastery was made from
                        coral stones and oak between 1887 and 1891. The cathedral, which is renowned for its sizable convent, was named a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine National Museum. The government declared its intention to add Lazi Church
                        to the World Heritage List in 2014. The Lazi Church also features two pulpits, which offer another fascinating detail that I have only ever noticed at this site and balance out the interior's symmetry. The Lazi Convent is one of
                        the largest convents in the Philippines. Its construction started in 1887, and in 1891 it was blessed.
